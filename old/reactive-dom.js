// Store the reactive variables that are created inside of an apply() call inside the parent reactive variable. Also store references to their dependencies separately. When we re-render and call apply() internally, if the list of subsidiary variables contains a ref with the same dependencies, we can just re-use this. If not, create a new variable. At the end, the variables that weren't bound to new ones get deleted from their dependencies' subscriptions.
// WARNING: this might cause more memory issues backwards! The references in the dependency list of the parent variable could be unsafe to hold onto, because if this component doesn't de-render it could keep alive the dependencies? This sounds like an issue because some components might almost never be torn down and so they could keep the dependencies and everything in their subscription lists open indefinitely. This could be even worse than the render objects staying open!
// Also, what if a nested reactive variable isn't used for rendering? What if it's an intermediary step? Will it even be culled at all?

// Other solution: at render time, briefly capture the variables depended on, then flush these variables, then delete them. That way they don't need to be kept alive during the duration of the component, only at render time. And so culled variables leftover from the previous derender are flushed out. But what if this is never re-rendered? What if we create an element and then never create the exact same one again, but do this over and over, creating more and more unique ones that will never be re-rendered to trigger flush clean up their culled remains?
